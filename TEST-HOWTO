Test the package by running the following command:

    ./with-venv [-n] [-i] pytest [pytest-args]
    
This will run 'pytest [pytest-args]' in a local virtual environment.

OPTIONS:
        -n  : force creation of a new env, overwriting any old
        -i  : install local package first via 'pip install -e .'

Source the ./aliases.sh file (from within the root folder!) for convenience aliases and functions.
